# My Bucket List
Simple Ruby on Rails app to create for the EXTS tutorial.

## Task 1
- [X] Generate views for the style guide in a new controller. Name the controller styles and create it with these views: atoms, molecules, and organisms.

- [X] Generate a view for the home page in a separate controller. Name the controller home and create it with this view: index.

- [ ] In the application.html.erb layout, add a normal stylesheet link to the style guide CSS files /css/main.css and /css/styleguide.css, which we added to the public/ folder previously.

- [ ] Attached to this unit in the resources section is a .zip file containing a file called homepage.html. Download and uncompress the .zip then open the homepage.html file in Atom. It includes HTML comments to indicate which parts within the <body> tag are for the application.html.erb layout and which are for the home/index.html.erb view. Extract these sections and put them into the appropriate places in application.html.erb and the home/index.html.erb view. Be careful not to remove the <%= yield %> tag in application.html.erb!

- [ ] For each of the view files created in task 1 for the style guide, replace its contents with the contents from the matching static HTML file within the public/ folder. For each view, this should be the <main> element and it's contents, within <body>.
